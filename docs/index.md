# Notes on Types and Programming Languages

These notes mostly follow the *Types and Programming Languages*[^1] book
by Bejamin C. Pierce, but may also contain additional remarks and may link to
other external resources.

!!! info "Language references"

    These notes also have a Rust[^2] language lean, but we also use a wide
    variety of programming language snippets to demonstrate various type systems
    and features, as well as their possible caveats and limitations.

    These programming languages include but are *not* limited to:

    - Rust
    - C
    - C++
    - Haskell
    - Idris
    - JavaScript
    - TypeScript
    - Java
    - Scala
    - Go

!!! note "Citation conventions"

    We use the IEEE Access citation style for [References].

    We use one of the following inline-citation style:

    === "Author-year Key"

        Examples:

        - [John1999]
        - [John2000a]

    === "Abbreviation Key"

        Examples:

        - [RFC793]
        - [CLRS]

    as the key to the [References].
