# Resources for Type Systems and Logics

Here we list various resources related to type systems and logics.

Resources can include blogs, papers, programs and projects, etc. Resources are
not grouped by topic, because a resource can span multiple topics and thus
resources are instead labelled by multiple knowledge tags.
